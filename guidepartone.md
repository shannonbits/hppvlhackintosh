# Hackintosh HP Pavilion Notebook InsydeH20
My HP Pavilion Notebook Hackintosh and, how i did it.

Disclaimers:
(Im Turkish and Most of the guides that are used in this repo is in Turkish. The repo may have some wrong words used, try using a translator if you don't understand anything.)

I will use macOS X Monterey on this guide, the things i use might not work on other versions.

Im gonna try to make this guide the easiest guide there is on the internet.

Please write something to me or this repo if you didn't get something, I will appricate it!

Im not a Professional, I learned by trying to fix my own mistakes. I can't do anything if your Computer can't run MacOS.

Guide Part:

Let's Get Started!

I Used a lot of websites but mostly a website named OSXINFO (https://osxinfo.net/), which is the best Hackintosh Website that i could find on turkish internet. There are a lot of guides on OSXINFO, check them if you know turkish!

Of Course, I didn't know what to do when i first started Hackintoshing, I used yusufklncc's Guide (https://osxinfo.net/konu/rehber-opencore-ile-adim-adim-macos-kurulumu.23648/#) on OSXINFO. 

First, you need to download the macOS X image, as i said im gonna use monterey. But, you can use any version you like.
